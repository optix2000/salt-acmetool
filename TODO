# TODO
Have user be settable
Be able to configure non-proxy modes
  Is this really necessary? acmetool tries all methods regardless of what you set.
Make a nginx includable file
Add cronjob
  Figure out how to reload nginx if you're nonroot
  We don't want root, since it's a possible security hazard if you're proxying to it.
  Proxying is cleaner [citation needed] than doing webroot, so should figure out a good way to do the reload hooks
